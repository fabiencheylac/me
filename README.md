# Introduction
French since 1992, web developer since 2011. I carry out studies of computer engineer and I realize various projects in good humor and always listening to the client. I like a lot of technologies of the web such as Javascript, PHP, and CSS. I enjoy working as a team and I think I have a certain social ease. I hope to continue my activity in web development around Aix-en-provence and perfecting my skills in project management.
